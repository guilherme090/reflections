When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When the project is shared with other people or when I work on it from different 
	machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes we need to work more on a feature before making it visible to the
	public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	1. Branches are created locally in a repository. They alter the flow that the commits
	would normally follow in a project so new features can be added or tests can be run.
	We use it when we want to add those features.
	
	2. Clones create a copy of a whole repository either locally or from Github with all
	the current commit history. We use them when we want to create a copy of the project
	to work on from a computer.
	
	3. Forks work similarly as clones, but they only operate inside Github and they also
	keep the reference to the original project, although changes in the new project
	will not affect the original. Forked projects can then be cloned. We use forks when
	we want to be able to refer back to the original project.
