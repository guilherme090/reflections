When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When the project is shared with other people or when I work on it from different 
	machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because sometimes we need to work more on a feature before making it visible to the
	public.
